# Particle Simulation using priority queues

## Minimum Priority Queue
The reason why this particle simulation runs smoothly is the implementation of a minimum priority queue with a binary heap. Hereby, it is important that adding and removing an item keeps the order of the binary heap to achieve O(log n) enqueuing and dequeuing of items.
